            <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-800">Why it matters:</span>
            <span>AI-generated content is everywhere‚Äîfrom emails to news articles to images and videos. Knowing how to spot it helps you make informed decisions, avoid scams, and understand the source of information.</span>
            <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mt-2">Checklist:</span>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-yellow-900">
              <li>Text is very neutral, polite, or generic.</li>
              <li>Sentences are well-structured but sometimes lack deep insight or personal experience.</li>
              <li>Repetitive phrases or ideas may appear.</li>
              <li>Information is accurate but lacks recent events or personal anecdotes.</li>
              <li>Text may overuse certain words or phrases (e.g., "certainly," "additionally").</li>
              <li>Responses are fast and consistent in tone.</li>
              <li>Images or videos may look slightly unnatural or have odd details (e.g., extra fingers, strange backgrounds).</li>
              <li>Content may lack strong opinions or emotional nuance.</li>
              <li>AI-generated videos often have smooth, robotic narration or perfect lighting.</li>
            </ul>
            <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mt-2">Tip:</span>
            <span>If in doubt, ask the writer for more personal details or recent experiences‚ÄîAI usually can't provide these! For images or videos, look for watermarks or use reverse image search tools.</span>
